# Sketch

This is my 12th year highschool project: Sketch (currently hosted on https://sketch.222alon.repl.co/)

It is a multiplayer drawing app where you can simultaneously draw with other people either in a public room or in a private room.

It was used to learn and show my knowledge of front-end development and design, networking by connecting users, and back-end development.

You can draw by pressing the left click and dragging the mouse, changing size and thickness with the sidebar tools, undoing a stroke with ctrl+z, and changing the background by 
copying an image to your clipboard and using ctrl+v to set it as the background.

You can also create an account and change some settings like your color pallete, and recover your account by email incase you forget your password.
